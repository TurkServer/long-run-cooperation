<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>The purpose of this HIT is to grant qualifications for a Microsoft Corporation research project. The research project will consist of 20 sessions, one per business day, over the course of 4 weeks. Each session will be held at the same time each day and will last about 30 minutes. If you choose to participate in the experiment, you will be expected to be present for each session.</p>

<p>Please note that you have no obligation to participate and you may decide to terminate your participation at any time. Also note that Microsoft has no obligation to disclose any research results. You understand that the researcher has the right to withdraw you from participation in the project at any time. Below is a description of the research project, and your consent to participate. You are asked to read this information carefully. If you agree to participate, check the box on the bottom of the page to indicate that you have read and understood the information furnished on this consent form.</p>

<h4>PROCEDURES</h4>
<p>After reading these instructions, you will be asked to take and pass a short quiz that tests your understanding of the rules of the game (as described below). You will be given two attempts to pass the quiz. If you fail twice, you will not be allowed to participate in the project. After passing the quiz, you will fill out a form describing your schedule and availability. We will use this information to decide what time of day to hold each session. We will then contact you when the experiment begins, after which point you will be responsible for coming to Amazon Mechanical Turk once per day at a specified time to complete a session. </p>

<p>In each session you will play a sequence of up to 20 games (the exact number depends on the availability of other players). In each game, you will be randomly paired with another player. A game consists of a sequence of 10 rounds. In each round, you will choose between two different actions (Choice 1 and Choice 2). You will have two minutes to make your decision. After both you and your opponent have made a decision, you will each receive a certain number of points. The table below shows the number of points associated with each possible combination of your choice and the choice of your opponent in each round:</p>

{{> payoffTable}}

<p>In each cell, the first number is the number of points you will receive, and the second number is the number of points your opponent will receive. Another way to understand the table is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li> If both you and your opponent select <span class="green">Choice 1</span>, you each earn {{payoffs.R}} points.</li>
<li> If you select <span class="green">Choice 1</span> and your opponent selects <span class="red">Choice 2</span>, you earn {{payoffs.S}} points and your opponent earns {{payoffs.T}} points.</li>
<li> If you select <span class="red">Choice 2</span> and your opponent selects <span class="green">Choice 1</span>, you earn {{payoffs.T}} points and your opponent earns {{payoffs.S}} points.</li>
<li> If both you and your opponent select <span class="red">Choice 2</span>, you each earn {{payoffs.P}} points.</li>
</ul>

<p>After you have completed 10 rounds, the game ends, and you will be randomly matched with another opponent for the next game. When you have completed 20 games (or as many as possible given the availability of other players), the session will end. You will then return the next day to complete another session, and so forth for 20 sessions over the course of 4 weeks.</p>

<p>You may be absent for at most 2 sessions. Leaving the session early before completing the required number of games counts as an absence. If you miss 2 or more sessions, you will not be allowed to return for the next session.</p>

<h4>COMPENSATION</h4>
<p>You will receive a base payment of 25 cents for each session. You will then earn additional compensation, based on number of points you earn during each session, in the form of a bonus paid on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Your score for the session is the sum of your points from each game. We will convert your score to dollars at the rate of 4 points = 1 cent. At the end of the 20 sessions, you will receive an additional bonus payment of 20% of the total payment you have already received.</p>

<h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>During the project we may need to collect personal information about you such as your city/town, age, marital status, occupation, education, ethnicity, etc. The personal information collected during this project will be used to perform research.

<h4>CONFIDENTIALITY</h4>
<p>The research project is confidential and you agree to: (a) never disclose it to anyone else (accept in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order); and (b) keep it secret as you would your own confidential information. Microsoft does not consider all information about the research project to be confidential.
