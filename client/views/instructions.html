<h4>Welcome.</h4>
<p>In this HIT, you will participate in an experiment on decision-making. What you earn depends on your decisions and on the decisions of others. Please read the following instructions carefully.</p>

<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>You will play a sequence of {{numGames}} games. In each game, you will be randomly paired with another Turker. A game consists of a sequence of {{numRounds}} rounds. In each round, you will choose between two different actions. After both you and your opponent have made a decision, you will each receive a certain number of points, and the next round will begin. After the game is over, you will be randomly matched with another opponent for the next game. When you have completed {{numGames}} games, you will be able to submit the HIT. </p>

<h5>Payment</h5>
<p>Your score for each game is the sum of your points from each round. Your score for the HIT is the sum of your points from each game. We will convert your score to dollars at the rate of $0.003 per point. The amount you earn will be given to you as the bonus for the HIT. Regardless of what decisions you make during the games, you will earn a base rate of 0.25 cents for completing the HIT.</p>

<h5>The Game</h5>
<p> In each round of the game, you will select between <span class="green">Choice 1</span> and <span class="red">Choice 2</span>. The number of points you receive depends both on your choice and the choice of your opponent. The table below shows the number of points associated with each possible combination of your choice and the choice of your opponent:
{{> payoffTable}}
In each cell, the first number is the number of points you will receive, and the second number is the number of points your opponent will receive. Another way to read the table is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> If both you and your opponent select <span class="green">Choice 1</span>, you each earn {{payoffs.R}}.</li>
<li> If you select <span class="green">Choice 1</span> and your opponent selects <span class="red">Choice 2</span>, you earn {{payoffs.S}} and your opponent earns {{payoffs.T}}.</li>
<li> If you select <span class="red">Choice 2</span> and your opponent selects <span class="green">Choice 1</span>, you earn {{payoffs.T}} and your opponent earns {{payoffs.S}}.</li>
<li> If both you and your opponent select <span class="red">Choice 2</span>, you each earn {{payoffs.P}}.</li>
</ul>
