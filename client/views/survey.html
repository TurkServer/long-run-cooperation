	      <h4>Study Debrief</h4>

	      <p>In this study you played a game known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma" target="_blank">Prisoner's Dilemma</a>, which is a classic two-player game often studied in economics and the social sciences. In this game, two players are each given a choice: either <b>cooperate</b> with your partner, or
              <b>defect</b>. The
              two players are not allowed to communicate. Depending on what the players choose, they each receive a specified payoff.</p>

	      <p>If the game is repeated for multiple rounds with the same partner (as in this study), it is called the <i>iterated</i> or <i>repeated</i> Prisoner's Dilemma.
              Thus every day for the past month, you played up to 20 ten-round games of iterated Prisoner's Dilemma &mdash; all in all, up to 400 games or 4,000 rounds.</p>

	      <p>Interestingly, when playing prisoner's dilemma, a purely <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory"
target="_blank">economically rational</a> player should always choose to defect.
This is because for a single round, 1) if you think your partner is going to
cooperate, then you should defect, because you'll earn more than if you
cooperate, and 2) if you think your partner is going to defect, then you should
also defect, because you'll again earn more than if you cooperate. So the
<i>equilibrium</i> of this game is for both players to always defect, regardless
of their partner's choice. Furthermore, if you believe that your partner is
going to defect in round 10, then you should defect in round 9, and so on, such
that there would be ten rounds of defection by both players in the iterated
game.</p>

	      <p>However, as you have experienced, people play this game differently in
reality. Most will cooperate with their partner for the first several rounds,
and defect in the last few rounds. So this means that people do not play
according to the "rational" equilibrium strategy as predicted by economics.</p>

	      <p>Our hypothesis was that if people play the game over and over again for a very
long period of time, they might eventually converge to the equilibrium strategy. Thus,
we recruited you to play the game every day with the same group for an entire month.</p>

	      <p>We really appreciate your commitment to this study. Thank you so much for participating!</p>
