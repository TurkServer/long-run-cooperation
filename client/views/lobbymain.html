      Once about {{numPlayers}} players have joined, we will begin the next game.</p>

    <p>Note that if there are an odd number of players, you might be left out when a game starts. But games go very quickly, so just wait a moment for the next one to begin.</p>

    <p>However, if you are left out for <strong>multiple</strong> games in a row, please email <a href="mailto:t-lilidw@microsoft.com">t-lilidw@microsoft.com</a>.</p>
