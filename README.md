# Cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemma

A web-based prisoner's dilemma experiment. This uses [TurkServer](https://github.com/HarvardEconCS/turkserver-meteor) to study how cooperation evolves in a large population over a long period of time.

Before diving into the code, you may want to check out [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), on which this app is built, or the [tutorial](http://virtuallab.github.io/) for TurkServer.
