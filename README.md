# Cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemma

A web-based prisoner's dilemma experiment. This uses [TurkServer](https://github.com/HarvardEconCS/turkserver-meteor) to study how cooperation evolves in a large population over a long period of time.

Before diving into the code, you may want to check out [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), on which this app is built, or the [tutorial](https://turkserver.readthedocs.io) for TurkServer.


# Get Startted:

1. `git clone https://github.com/TurkServer/long-run-cooperation.git`
2. `cd long-run-cooperation`, manually add turkserver and meteor-timesync or automatically add both if you do `git clone --recursive` and `git submodule update --init`
3. `meteor --settings settings-template.json`
