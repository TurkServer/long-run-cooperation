<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>Thank you for deciding to volunteer in a Microsoft Corporation research project. The research project will consist of 20 sessions, one per business day, over the course of 4 weeks. Please note that you have no obligation to participate and you may decide to terminate your participation at any time. Also note that Microsoft has no obligation to disclose any research results. You understand that the researcher has the right to withdraw you from participation in the project at any time. Below is a description of the research project, and your consent to participate. You are asked to read this information carefully. If you agree to participate, check the box on the bottom of the page to indicate that you have read and understood the information furnished on this consent form.</p>

<h4>PROCEDURES</h4>
<p>In each session you will play a sequence of up to 20 games (the exact number depends on the availability of other players). In each game, you will be randomly paired with another player. A game consists of a sequence of 10 rounds. In each round, you will choose between two different actions (Choice 1 and Choice 2). You will have two minutes to make your decision. After both you and your opponent have made a decision, you will each receive a certain number of points. After you have completed 10 rounds, the game ends, and you will be randomly matched with another opponent for the next game. When you have completed 20 games (or as many as possible given the availability of other players), the session will end. You will then return the next day to complete another session, and so forth for 20 sessions over the course of 4 weeks. You may be absent for at most 2 sessions. Leaving the session early before completing the required number of games counts as an absence. If you miss 2 or more sessions, you will not be allowed to return for the next session.</p>

<h4>COMPENSATION</h4>
<p>You will receive a base payment of 25 cents for each session. You will then earn additional compensation, based on number of points you earn during each session, in the form of a bonus paid on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Your score for the session is the sum of your points from each game. We will convert your score to dollars at the rate of 4 points = 1 cent. At the end of the 20 sessions, you will receive an additional bonus payment of 20% of the total payment you have already received.</p>

<h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>During the project we may need to collect personal information about you such as your city/town, age, marital status, occupation, education, ethnicity, etc. The personal information collected during this project will be used to perform research. Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide during this project will not be shared outside of Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.</p>

<h4>RESEARCH DATA & FEEDBACK</h4>

Microsoft does not consider all information about the research project to be confidential.
